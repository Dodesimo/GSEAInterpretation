The provided data indicates a significant downregulation of numerous signaling pathways and biological processes in NK cells with TIM3 knockout, with only a few pathways being upregulated. The upregulated pathways are related to cap-dependent translation initiation and activation of BH3-only proteins, which may suggest an increase in protein synthesis and pro-apoptotic signaling, respectively. The extensive downregulation of pathways, including those involved in immune signaling (e.g., interferon signaling, T cell receptor signaling, and NF-kappaB pathways), suggests a broad suppression of immune response capabilities. This could be attributed to the absence of TIM3, a known immune checkpoint receptor that modulates immune cell activity. The downregulation of pathways related to cell signaling, apoptosis, and cytokine activity further supports the hypothesis that TIM3 knockout leads to impaired NK cell function and reduced immune surveillance. The potential mechanism underlying these observations could involve the loss of TIM3-mediated inhibitory signals, which normally balance NK cell activation and prevent excessive immune responses. Without TIM3, NK cells may become dysregulated, leading to altered gene expression profiles that favor a suppressed immune state. This could have implications for understanding the role of TIM3 in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases where NK cell activity is critical.
